# **Project Overview**

## **1. Introduction**

This project aims to build an online educational platform that addresses the challenges faced in Vietnam's public education system, such as managing large classrooms, accommodating different learning paces, and encouraging student interaction. By personalizing the learning experience, the platform empowers students to take control of their education, follow their own learning pace, and engage more actively with their teachers and peers. It also facilitates close interaction between teachers and students, providing a flexible and efficient learning environment enhanced by technology to optimize student comprehension.

## **2. Problem Statement**

- **Overcrowded Classrooms**: Teachers find it difficult to give individual attention, leading to students struggling to grasp lessons.
- **Diverse Learning Paces**: Some students fall behind, while others become disengaged due to the varying speeds at which students learn.
- **Lack of Interaction**: Students may hesitate to ask questions in class, resulting in shallow understanding and insufficient assessment of their comprehension.

## **3. Solution**

The platform provides a comprehensive online learning environment that mirrors the real-time classroom experience and enhances it through personalization and technology.

- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Students learn at their own pace, with the system tracking progress and providing recommendations.
- **AI Integration**: Artificial Intelligence filters student questions, prioritizes them for teacher responses, and recommends courses based on student progress and ratings.
- **Interactive Tools**: Features like discussion boards, Q&A sections, and chat systems facilitate collaboration between students and teachers.
- **Credit Point System**: Encourages student engagement by rewarding participation, which also serves as a formative assessment tool for teachers.
- **Teacher Empowerment**: Teachers can manage online classes, monitor student progress, and earn additional income by offering courses to students outside their regular classes.

## **4. Target Users**

- **Students**: Public school students who can learn at their own pace, access quality resources anytime, and receive personalized support.
