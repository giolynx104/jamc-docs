## Problems

- [ ] Can this platform be integrated with the existing traditional classes? Do we have any problem with the laws (in Education)
- [ ] Point of view: we need surveys
  - [ ] From teachers
  - [ ] From students

### **1. Problem Understanding**:

- **Is the core problem clearly defined?**

  - Do you fully understand the issues students and teachers face in traditional learning environments?
  - Have you explored whether the lack of interaction and personalized learning is the primary pain point for both students and teachers?

- **Are there any other underlying problems that haven’t been addressed?**
  - For example, how will this platform handle technical literacy? What if students/teachers aren’t comfortable using the platform?

### **2. User Personas and Their Needs**:

- **Who are the primary users?**

  - You’ve defined students and teachers, but what about other potential users like school administrators or parents? How do their roles fit into the platform?

- **What are the specific needs of each user type?**
  - Are students more focused on flexibility, while teachers are looking for better engagement? Are the tools provided meeting each user’s specific needs?
  - How will this platform engage students who are less motivated? How will it assist teachers in managing student diversity (in terms of ability and learning pace)?

### **3. Business Logic for Personalized Learning**:

- **How will the platform adjust to the different learning paces of students?**

  - Will there be some adaptive learning technology that tracks student progress and suggests new content or exercises based on their performance?
  - How do students get feedback or support if they are falling behind? Are there recommendations for additional study resources?

- **How personalized is the interaction between teacher and student?**
  - Will teachers have access to detailed analytics of each student’s progress, enabling them to provide personalized feedback?
  - Will the system suggest interventions if a student is struggling? If so, how are these interventions determined?

### **4. Interaction and Engagement**:

- **How will the platform encourage consistent interaction?**

  - Will there be any **incentive mechanisms** for students to engage, beyond the credit points? For example, could there be additional rewards or recognition for students who actively participate or help others?

- **How can teachers manage interaction effectively?**
  - With a potentially large number of students, how will the teacher prioritize which questions to answer?
  - Can the system categorize or highlight critical questions automatically?

### **5. Assessment and Feedback Loop**:

- **How will student progress be assessed beyond quizzes?**

  - Will the platform offer other forms of assessment like project-based assignments, peer reviews, or teacher-led evaluations?

- **How will feedback be delivered?**
  - Will feedback be provided only through automated systems (like quiz results), or will there be manual teacher feedback on open-ended assignments?

### **6. Monetization and Sustainability**:

- **How will this platform generate revenue?**

  - Will students pay for access to premium features or personalized content?
  - Will there be a subscription model for schools or teachers?
  - If the platform is free, how will you maintain and scale it financially?

- **What are the incentives for teachers?**
  - Will they be compensated for their time on the platform? How will the platform encourage high-quality teachers to join and contribute?

### **7. Scaling and Adaptation**:

- **How will the platform scale with a large number of users?**
  - As more students and teachers join, can the platform continue to provide personalized learning experiences without slowing down?
- **Can the platform adapt to other educational contexts or levels?**
  - For instance, could it be used in higher education or even in corporate training environments?

### **8. Student and Teacher Autonomy**:

- **How much autonomy do students and teachers have?**
  - Will students have freedom to choose the courses they want, or will there be recommendations/mandatory courses?
  - How much control will teachers have over the content they create? Can they make changes to courses dynamically based on student performance?

### **9. Success Metrics**:

- **How will the success of the platform be measured?**
  - Will you track student progress, course completion rates, or engagement metrics (e.g., number of questions asked)?
  - How will you measure **learning outcomes** and **student satisfaction**?

### **10. Long-Term Vision**:

- **How will the platform evolve over time?**
  - What are the future features or improvements that could be added as the platform grows (e.g., AI-driven tutoring, collaborative projects, or VR learning environments)?
  - How do you envision this platform in 2-3 years? Will it focus on K-12 education only, or will it expand to other educational sectors?

By answering these questions, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of your **business logic**, user needs, and how your platform should be structured to meet those needs effectively. This will help refine your overall solution and ensure that every feature aligns with solving the core problem.

Which specific questions resonate with you the most, and would you like to explore them further?
