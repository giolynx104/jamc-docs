# Business Logic of JAMC

## 1. Target Users

**Students**
High school students learning at their own pace, with access to personalized content and interaction with their teacher.

**Teachers**
High school teachers who upload course content, manage student progress, and earn additional revenue by attracting students outside their primary class.

## 2. Key Features and Business Processes

**Course Creation and Management**

- Teachers create courses based on the official curriculum from the Ministry of Education and Training.
- Courses include video lectures, quizzes, supplemental materials, and interactive features (except live sessions).
- Teachers manage the content by updating lessons and resources yearly, allowing flexibility for minor updates.

**Student Enrollment and Access**

- Students in the teacher's class access the course content for free.
- Paid access: If students want to enroll in courses from other teachers, they will need to pay a fee.
- Rating System: Courses are rated by students, and high-rated courses are recommended more frequently through the platform's AI algorithm.

**Personalized Learning**

- Students progress at their own pace, but they need to follow school milestones (e.g., complete certain modules by a specific week).
- Self-Assessment for Students: Allow students to assess their own learning pace through quick check-ins or quizzes. If a student feels they are falling behind, they can voluntarily flag themselves for additional support or resources before the teacher steps in.
- AI-based content suggestions help students stay on track based on their progress, learning habits, and engagement.

**Discussion and Q&A**

- Discussion boards enable students to collaborate and ask questions at any time. These are lesson-specific so that discussions are relevant.
- Credit Points: Students can earn points by asking insightful questions or answering their peers' questions.
- Teachers and peers can upvote questions and responses, and credit points are awarded based on engagement.

**Credit Points System**

- Incentive for engagement: Students gain credit points for their participation (e.g., asking good questions, answering others).
- Credit points appear in the student's profile and may unlock rewards like badges or extra learning materials.
- Teachers can use credit points as a formative assessment tool to gauge student participation and critical thinking.

**Teacher Revenue Model**

- Teachers earn revenue by offering high-quality courses that attract students beyond their regular classroom.
- Course ratings determine visibility and recommendation levels, fostering competition among teachers. Highly-rated teachers receive more student enrollment and, therefore, more income.

**Progress Tracking and Analytics**

- Teachers can track student progress through a dashboard, which shows quiz results, course completion status, and engagement levels.
- Students have a personalized dashboard that tracks their progress, credit points, and overall grades.

**AI-Driven Recommendations**

- AI filters and prioritizes questions asked by students to help teachers manage their time and focus on important questions.
- AI recommends courses based on ratings, student progress, and learning behaviors.

**Course Content Structure**
- Courses follow the official books from the Ministry of Education and Training to maintain consistency across classes.
- Teachers are encouraged to customize content while adhering to the official curriculum, ensuring flexibility and personalization.

## Business Logic Summary

- The platform provides personalized learning paths while keeping students engaged with their peers through discussions and collaborative work.
- Credit points and rating systems incentivize both students and teachers to participate and deliver high-quality content.
- Teachers have flexibility in how they structure their courses, but they must follow the official curriculum.
- AI is integrated to manage course recommendations, filter questions, and enhance the student learning experience.
- No live sessions are needed, as offline interaction already occurs in the classroom.
